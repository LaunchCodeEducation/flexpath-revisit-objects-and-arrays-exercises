## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

## Testing / Verification

Include relevant details here about where solution files are stored

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Objects in JavaScript**:
    
    - Understanding what objects are and how they serve as containers for key-value pairs.
    - Creating objects using object literals and the `new` keyword.
    - Object properties and methods, including how to add, update, and delete properties.
    - Reference types vs. primitive types and the implications for memory management.
    - Using `Object.create` to define custom prototypes.
    - Understanding how JavaScript uses prototypes and the prototype chain.
2. **Array Manipulation**:
    
    - Creating arrays using literals and the `Array` constructor.
    - Adding and removing elements using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.
    - Using `splice` and `slice` for modifying and extracting array elements.
    - Combining arrays with `concat` and the spread operator.
    - Cloning arrays and the concept of shallow vs. deep copying.
3. **Iteration Methods**:
    
    - Using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for efficient array iteration and manipulation.
    - Understanding the power and use cases for these methods compared to traditional `for` loops.
4. **Prototypes and Inheritance**:
    
    - How objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.
    - The difference between object-oriented principles and JavaScriptâ€™s prototype-based inheritance.
    - The use of `Object.defineProperty` and property descriptors to control object properties.
5. **Advanced Topics**:
    
    - Memory management with stack and heap.
    - Concepts like object freezing with `Object.freeze` and sealing with `Object.seal`.
    - Enumerability, property attributes, and protecting object properties.
