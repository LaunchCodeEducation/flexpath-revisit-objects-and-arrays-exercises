    To run the code you write for each exercise, change the `exercise_01()` code below to match the EXACT name
     of the exercise, as it is written in the line `function exercise_xx`.
    
     For Example:

     If I want to run exercise_05 below, I would change the code below from "exercise_01()" to
     "exercise_05()", save this file. 
		 
		 Then, when I run this file by running `node exercise.js`
     in the VS Code terminal while inside this folder, your code for exercise_05 will run.
