Explanation:

Array.prototype is extended using Object.defineProperty.

The last method returns the last element.

The method is set to non-enumerable to prevent interference with iteration over arrays.

Ensuring non-enumerability avoids conflicts with code that relies on the 
default behavior of arrays.
