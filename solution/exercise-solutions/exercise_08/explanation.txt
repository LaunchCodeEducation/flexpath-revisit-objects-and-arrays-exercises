Explanation:

Shallow copying with spread operator copies the array but not the nested objects (they are references).
Modifying a nested object in the shallow copy affects the original array.
Deep copying is done by mapping each object and creating a new object with spread {...obj}.
Modifications in the deep copy do not affect the original array.
