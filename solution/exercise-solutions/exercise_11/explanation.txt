Explanation:

Object.seal prevents adding or deleting properties but allows modification of existing properties.
Object.freeze prevents adding, deleting, or modifying properties.
Both methods make the object's property configuration non-configurable.
In non-strict mode, operations that fail do so silently; in strict mode, they throw errors.
