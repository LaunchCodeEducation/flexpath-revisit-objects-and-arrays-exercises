Explanation:

Shape is a constructor function with an area method.
Rectangle constructor initializes width and height.
Rectangle.prototype is set to a new object created from Shape.prototype, establishing inheritance.
The constructor property is reset to Rectangle after prototype chaining.
The area method is overridden in Rectangle.
instanceof checks confirm that rectangle is an instance of both Rectangle and Shape.
